# Cards
The idea is to create a shufflable card deck that is capable of being used for a large variety of card games.
I'm particularly going to use this for "Sequence solver" to calculate the team that's most capable of winning the board/card game "Sequence" with perfect play.

#TODO "Sequence":
Create a system using weights to figure out where the next card should be placed.
Create a system to get 5 in a row quickly with the weight system.
Create a system to do both teams at the same time and subtract weights based off proximity of other team.
Figure out how to do all of these within n^2 time.
